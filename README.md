Just a quick game I made for the Seajam Game Jam by Polymars. I'm quite interested in saving the climate and so when Polymars announced this Jam, I knew I'd want in.
The idea for this game is that you have to spend money to increase fish and decrease pollution, but every turn, random events can occur which harm you. 
Your goal is to take the right actions to save the fish and reduce the pollution
Please feel free to comment and improve my code, that is if anybody even finds this. :D
